Mjolnir is a modern, web-based IDE designed specifically for Polkadot smart contract development, offering powerful analysis tools and a seamless development experience similar to Remix IDE.

## ‚ö° Key Features

### Contract Analysis & Security

- **Static Analysis**: Comprehensive code analysis for security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and code quality issues
- **Gas Efficiency Checks**: Built-in analysis for gas optimization opportunities
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed scoring system for contract performance, security, and code quality
- **Smart Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions for improving contract security and efficiency

### Development Environment

- **Modern Web Interface**: Built with Next.js and React for a smooth development experience
- **Monaco Editor Integration**: Feature-rich code editing with syntax highlighting and autocompletion
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant feedback on code quality and potential issues

## üöß Features in Development

The following features are actively being worked on and will be available in future releases:

- **Contract Deployment**: Direct deployment to Polkadot networks
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive testing suite for smart contracts
- **Interactive Debugging**: Step-by-step contract execution debugging
- **Contract Verification**: Automated verification tools for deployed contracts

## üõ† Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start the development server
yarn dev
```

## üîç Analysis Engine

Mjolnir's analyzer is powered by a robust Rust-based analysis engine that examines contracts across multiple dimensions:

- **Security Analysis**: Detection of common vulnerabilities and security anti-patterns
- **Performance Optimization**: Identification of performance bottlenecks and inefficient patterns
- **Gas Efficiency**: Analysis of gas usage patterns and optimization opportunities
- **Code Quality**: Enforcement of best practices and code quality standards
